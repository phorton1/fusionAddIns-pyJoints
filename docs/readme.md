This Fusion360 AddIn allows you to **animate joints and their
relationships** using relatively simple scripts written in Python.
It also facilitates the process of creating **animated GIFs**, like
the one below, from those scripts.

When this AddIn is installed and running **the pyJoints command** will be
found in the Fusion 360 **Design-ASSEMBLE** drop-down menu.

## Motivation

This addIn was written because I had difficulty using the existing
features in Fusion360, including *contact sets*, *tangent relationships*,
*motion links*, *motion studies*, and/or the entire Fusion 360 *Animation*
and *Simulation* 'products' to model the motion of a electromagnetic driven
pendulum wooden geared clock that I was designing.

If you are trying to model the motion of a machine that you have designed
in Fusion 360 and are having similar difficulties ... that the provided
features are too simple, don't work well, or just simply don't do
what you need ... then perhaps this AddIn can help you.
